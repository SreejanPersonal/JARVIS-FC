## üöÄ Jarvis: A Daily-Expanding AI

Jarvis is an AI assistant built using Groq's advanced function calling.  This project is updated *daily*, adding new features and capabilities. Follow along on YouTube to see its evolution!

**Current Capabilities (Updated Daily):**

* **Day 1:**  Powerful foundation! Jarvis can now perform file operations (read, write, list, delete), retrieve system information (OS, memory, disk), manage processes, fetch weather updates, convert currencies, and manage quick notes.  Explore the `DAY 1` folder.
* **Day 2 & Beyond:**  New features are added daily!  Check back frequently and watch the YouTube series for announcements of new capabilities. Each day's code is in a separate folder (e.g., `DAY 2`, `DAY 3`).

---

## üíª Getting Started

This project uses Python and requires a Groq API key. Because it's a work in progress, you'll download the code for each day separately:


1. **One-Time Repository Clone:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SreejanPersonal/JARVIS-FC.git
   cd JARVIS-FC
   ```

2. **Daily Updates:**
    * Navigate to the `DAY X` folder corresponding to the day's code (e.g., `DAY 1`, `DAY 2`).
    * Copy the contents of that folder to your local project directory, overwriting the previous day's folder if necessary.

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Obtain Your Groq API Key:** Get your key from [Groq's website](https://groq.com) and replace `"gsk_YOUR_API_KEY"` in `core/assistant.py` with your key.


## üèÉ Running Jarvis

Once you have the code for the desired day:

```bash
python main.py
```

Jarvis starts in interactive mode.  Use `exit` to quit, `clear` to start a new conversation (keeping history), and `new` to clear all history.
